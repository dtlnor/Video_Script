# Video_Script

## Mygo Compare

 performance super slow as using python cv2. Will made a cv pencil plugin if I want to waste my time to speed up this script.

 ### 9th Fx

 (not exactly as I refine the script after posting this video and lazy to reupload it)  
 (I believe there is a better way to do it in ass effect, but I know nothing about it)  
 require https://github.com/dtlnor/VapourSynth-cv_ccl_filter  
 
 ### Live Stream Style

 I am too lazy to found a way to autotrace the subtitle in ass effect tag.
 So I do the inpaint and adaptive border (depends on subtitle width) in VS.
 NOT recommending anyone apply effects like in this way.
