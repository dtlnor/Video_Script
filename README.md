# Video_Script
 some weird script I write when I refuse to open adobe

## Mygo Compare
 script for producing this vid https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jb421Y7Ak
 require vapoursynth with audio output support

## one-last-mygo
 script for producing this vid https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1tj41117af

 performance super slow as using python cv2. Will made a cv pencil plugin if I want to waste my time to speed up this script.
